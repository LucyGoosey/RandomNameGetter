# Random Name Getter

Grabs a selection of random names from a .csv file. Personally I used the files found [here](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/names/babies-first-names/full-lists-of-babies-first-names-2010-to-2014)

But anything with the format ```name,[B|G]``` (where B/G represents Boy/Girl) is suitable.

### Prerequisites

Uses Python2.x

## Usage
Have a .csv in the format described above and save it in the directory as ```bname.csv```, run either ```namegen.py``` for a terminal-based version or ```NameGenerator.pyw``` for a version with a GUI.
